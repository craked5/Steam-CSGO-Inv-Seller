HI!

This is a simple tool to sell your CS:GO inventory on the Steam Market at the lowest price (generally).

This program is written in Python and has the following external dependecies:

Crypto - pip install pycrypto
Requests - pip install requests
Beautiful soup - pip install beautifulsoup4

For this to work you have to retrieve your Steam Market cookies from your browser.
The cookies you will need are:
  -steamLogin
  -steamLoginSecure
  -sessionid
  -webTradeEligibility
  -steamMachineAuth (you will need the name and the content for this, in this format: name=content)
  
The first time you run this, it will ask you to input all the cookies above aswell as your Steam username and password.
The next times this will be saved and will be automatically retrieved.

After all the login stuff is done you are ready to use this.
It will ask you for your Steam inventory link (like this: http://steamcommunity.com/id/craked5/inventory) and then
it will ask you if you have any item in your inventory that you dont want to sell, just follow the instructions.

When all this is done, you should see it selling all your items (except the ones that you dont want to sell).

If any anything goes wrong just contact me here or on my email.

If you enjoyed this program please consider donating some cheap skins or a lousy $ as i am a poor college student :)
